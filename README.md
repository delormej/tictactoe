The problem with this simplistic approach is that it can exhaust all possible moves thru chance.  
Player O has 8 possible moves after Player X first plays.  If Player X wins all 8, Player O will have no more chances.

Is this really all that likely though? 8 moves, each of which has 7 moves, each of which has 6 moves, etc... 8 factorial!
